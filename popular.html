            Founded by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988) in 1939 from the Alfa Romeo racing division 
            as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first 
            Ferrari-badged car in 1947.

            Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.
            In October 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate 
            Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.
            The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. 
            (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari S.p.A. group, and the subsequent sale by 
            FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
            Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA,
            with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari. The spin-off was completed on the 3rd of January 2016.

            As a subsidiary of its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.

            founded by engineer August Horch (1868–1951); and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), 
            leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. 
            The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.

            Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, 
            thus creating the present-day form of the company.
